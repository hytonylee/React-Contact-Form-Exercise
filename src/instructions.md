Extend the ContactForm of this cool website and add the following features:

- The user cannot submit the newsletter form without first filling in a name and **valid** email.
- The name and email can both be at max 120 characters in length.
- The user should always know why the submission failed (e.g. name field not filled, email not a valid email, etc.)
- Display a green "Subscribed!" message below the "Subscribe" button if the user successfully subscribes (no validation error occured)
- On successful submission, reset the user input.
- Remove the green "Subscribed!" message again, if the user starts changing the input on either the name or email input field.

The provided code was added by our manager without much knowledge about HTML or React. It is meant as a starting point and can certainly be changed.

The CSS was added by our design team and should only be extended. Don't change the existing CSS (e.g. colors) as it comes from our design team.
